# Horiseon Info Graphic Website

## Description

This webiste is a info graphic on multiple topics such as "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing". There is also a side bar with info on "Lead Gneration", "Brand Awareness", and "Cost Management". There are working clickable links on the nav bar at the top of the page and multiple working styling classes applied to the page.

I wanted a working webpage that shows info on many of the important facts for those topics. I also wanted to make the webpage accessible and easy to find with SEO. 

I learned semantic structuring, commenting on code, and some more git commands.
